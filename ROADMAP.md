## Content
### Information
- Make different resume for non-technical stuff (writing)
- Cooler portfolio page?
  - Maybe something like http://hakim.se/experiments

### Presentation
- Stylesheet!

## System structure
### Under consideration
- Make resume data more rich/complex than current Markdown document
- Generate Markdown from data alongside HTML generation
- Replacing the skeleton + DOM approach for generating resume.html with mustache/hogan templates
  - This would enable Markdown generation as described above
